In this repo, I want to take on code challenges from CodeSignal, LeetCode etc at my leisure times, 
I want to attempt solving the problems in 5 languages Python, Java, C++,PHP and JavaScript. 
I would try to organize the structure and commits as much as I remember to :).
I'm looking to learn and have fun doing it.
